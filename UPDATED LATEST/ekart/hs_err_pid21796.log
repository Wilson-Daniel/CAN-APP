# Native memory allocation (mmap) failed to map 127926272 bytes for Failed to commit area from 0x0000000087a00000 to 0x000000008f400000 of length 127926272.
# Possible reasons:
#   The system is out of physical RAM or swap space
#   The process is running with CompressedOops enabled, and the Java Heap may be blocking the growth of the native heap
# Possible solutions:
#   Reduce memory load on the system
#   Increase physical memory or swap space
#   Check if swap backing store is full
