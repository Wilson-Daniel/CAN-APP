# There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.
# Native memory allocation (mmap) failed to map 177209344 bytes for Failed to commit area from 0x0000000087a00000 to 0x0000000092300000 of length 177209344.
# Possible reasons:
#   The system is out of physical RAM or swap space
#   The process is running with CompressedOops enabled, and the Java Heap may be blocking the growth of the native heap
# Possible solutions:
#   Reduce memory load on the system
#   Increase physical memory or swap space
#   Check if swap backing store is full
#   Decrease Java heap size (-Xmx/-Xms)
#   Decrease number of Java threads
#   Decrease Java thread stack sizes (-Xss)
#   Set larger code cache with -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=
